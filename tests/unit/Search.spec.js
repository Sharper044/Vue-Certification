// The following components will be contained on the search page:
// Search bar
// Main view component with youtube video, title and description
// Sidebar with search results

// Create a search bar where a user can input any search string. The input should search on either the enter/return key press or by clicking on a search icon at the end of the search input.

// When a search is initiated an HTTP request should be made to the Youtube API to retrieve the first 10 search results for the submitted query string (You will probably want to use Axios to make this HTTP request).

// The search results should be displayed in a sidebar (which can be displayed on either side of the screen). The results should display a thumbnail of the video, a video title and a short video description.

// The main section of the screen should have the first video of the search results displayed. Under the video player should be the video title and the full video description.

// When any video is selected (clicked) in the results sidebar, that video should then be displayed in the main section with the video's title and description.
