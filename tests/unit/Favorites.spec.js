// This page will have a similar layout to the Search page with the following differences:

// The search bar will search through (filter) the user's favorite selected videos
// The sidebar will display the user's favorited videos
// Update the Search components so that a clickable icon will be displayed when the user's cursor hovers over any video in the sidebar results. When a user clicks on this "favorite" icon that video is added to the user's favorited videos. Repeated clicks on the icon will toggle the video in/out of the user's favorited videos.

// Add the same icon to the main section on the Search page so that the selected video can be toggled in/out of the user's favorite videos.

// Add the functionality to filter the user's favorite videos by any query string.

// Add sorting functionality by video title, date added and video length. Add a component over the sidebar that allows a user to sort by these additional video criteria.
